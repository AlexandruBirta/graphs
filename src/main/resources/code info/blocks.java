//To calculate the number of blocks in a graph using an adjacency list representation, you can use the concept of graph traversal and connected components. Here's an implementation in Java:
//
//        In this implementation, the Graph class represents the graph using an adjacency list. The addEdge method adds an undirected edge between two vertices. The countBlocks method calculates the number of blocks by performing a graph traversal and counting the number of connected components. The traverse method recursively explores the graph starting from a vertex and marks visited vertices.
//
//        In the main method, a sample graph is created with 6 vertices and edges connecting them. The countBlocks method is called to calculate the number of blocks, and the result is printed.
//
//        Feel free to modify the code to suit your specific graph or add additional functionality as needed.
