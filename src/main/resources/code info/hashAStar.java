// The Hash Distributed A* algorithm is a parallelized version of the A* algorithm that distributes the search workload across multiple processors or threads using a hash-based partitioning strategy.
// Here's an implementation of the Hash Distributed A* algorithm for adjacency list-based graphs in Java:
// In this implementation, the Hash Distributed A* algorithm distributes the search workload by using a hash-based partitioning strategy. Each node is assigned to a specific processor or thread based on its hash value. The algorithm uses a priority queue (openSet) to store the nodes to be expanded, and a set (closedSet) to keep track of the visited nodes.

// The hashDistributedAStar function performs the Hash Distributed A* search algorithm. It maintains g-scores and f-scores for each node, and a parent map to reconstruct the final path. The algorithm iteratively expands the nodes with the lowest f-scores, updates the g-scores and f-scores of their neighbors if a shorter path is found, and terminates when the target node is reached or there are no more nodes to expand.

// The reconstructPath function is used to reconstruct the path from the source node to the target node using the parent map. It starts from the target node and follows the parents back to the source node, resulting in a list of nodes representing the shortest path.

// The heuristicCost function calculates the heuristic cost from a given node to the target node. This cost function is problem-specific and can be tailored to the characteristics of your application domain. In the provided implementation, a simple heuristic is used where the cost is the absolute difference between node IDs.

// The buildGraph function is responsible for constructing the graph specific to your problem domain. Nodes are created, and their neighbors are defined by adding them to the neighbors list along with the corresponding edge weights.

// You can modify the buildGraph function to create and connect the nodes based on your specific graph structure.

// Please note that this implementation assumes an undirected graph, where each edge is represented as a connection between two nodes in both directions. Modify the code accordingly if you are working with a directed graph or if your graph structure differs.
