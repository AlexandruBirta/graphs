//In this implementation, the Node class represents a node in the graph, and each node maintains a list of its neighboring nodes.
//
// The PBFS1DPartitioning class contains the main logic for the PBFS algorithm with 1-dimensional partitioning. The algorithm is executed using multiple processors, where each processor has its own queue. The numProcessors variable determines the number of processors to be used. The processorQueue array holds the current queue of each processor, and the nextProcessorQueue array is used to simulate message passing between processors.
//
// The algorithm starts from a designated start node (node 0) and traverses the graph in a breadth-first manner. Each processor processes its own portion of the graph and updates the level of each node in the level array. Message passing between processors is simulated by updating the processorQueue and nextProcessorQueue arrays.
//
// The buildGraph method is responsible for constructing the graph specific to your problem domain. Nodes are created, and their neighboring nodes are defined by adding them to the neighbors list.
//
// When you run the code, it will execute the PBFS algorithm with 1-dimensional partitioning on the provided graph. It will output the level of each node in the graph.
//
// Feel free to modify the buildGraph method to create and connect the nodes based on your specific graph structure.
//
// You can experiment with different graph structures, change the number of processors, and observe how the algorithm works with message passing in a distributed memory setting.
