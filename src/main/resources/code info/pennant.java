//The "pennant" data structure is not directly related to adjacency list-based graphs. It is a data structure used in binary heap implementations for efficient insertion and merging operations. The pennant data structure is a specialized form of a binary tree with a particular shape and properties.
//
//        However, if you're looking for an implementation of the pennant data structure itself, here's an example implementation in Java:
//
//
//        In this implementation, the Pennant class represents a single pennant in the pennant data structure. Each pennant has a value and references to its left and right child pennants.
//
//        In the main method, a sample pennant is created with a value of 10. Two child pennants with values 5 and 7 are created and connected to the parent pennant. Finally, the values of the pennants are accessed and printed.
//
//        Please note that this implementation is a basic example to demonstrate the structure of a pennant and its connections. In practical applications, pennants are often used as building blocks for more complex data structures such as binary heaps.

class Pennant<T> {
    private T value;
    private Pennant<T> leftChild;
    private Pennant<T> rightChild;

    public Pennant(T value) {
        this.value = value;
        this.leftChild = null;
        this.rightChild = null;
    }

    public T getValue() {
        return value;
    }

    public Pennant<T> getLeftChild() {
        return leftChild;
    }

    public void setLeftChild(Pennant<T> leftChild) {
        this.leftChild = leftChild;
    }

    public Pennant<T> getRightChild() {
        return rightChild;
    }

    public void setRightChild(Pennant<T> rightChild) {
        this.rightChild = rightChild;
    }
}

public class PennantDataStructure {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Create a pennant with value 10
        Pennant<Integer> pennant = new Pennant<>(10);

        // Create left and right child pennants with values 5 and 7
        Pennant<Integer> leftChild = new Pennant<>(5);
        Pennant<Integer> rightChild = new Pennant<>(7);

        // Connect the left and right child pennants to the parent pennant
        pennant.setLeftChild(leftChild);
        pennant.setRightChild(rightChild);

        // Access the values of the pennants
        System.out.println("Value of pennant: " + pennant.getValue());
        System.out.println("Value of left child: " + pennant.getLeftChild().getValue());
        System.out.println("Value of right child: " + pennant.getRightChild().getValue());
    }
}
